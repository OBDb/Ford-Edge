## Generations

- **First Generation (2007-2014)**: Introduced as Ford's first mid-size crossover SUV, built on the CD3 platform shared with the Fusion. It featured a 3.5L V6 engine producing 265 hp, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Available in both front-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations. A 3.7L V6 engine option was added in 2011, along with MyFord Touch infotainment system. The Sport trim was introduced in 2009 with a more powerful engine and sport-tuned suspension.

- **Second Generation (2015-present)**: Built on the CD4 platform, this generation brought significant updates to styling, technology, and powertrains. Base engine options include a 2.0L EcoBoost four-cylinder and a more powerful 2.7L EcoBoost V6 for the Sport trim (later ST trim). Features adaptive steering, enhanced safety technologies, and the SYNC 3 infotainment system. A mid-cycle refresh in 2019 introduced a new 8-speed automatic transmission, updated styling, and additional safety features. The ST performance variant replaced the Sport trim, offering improved handling and more aggressive styling.
