    description: "The original Ford Edge was a mid-size crossover SUV built on Ford's CD3 platform shared with the Fusion sedan. Featuring a bold, muscular design with a prominent three-bar grille, it helped establish the crossover segment as an alternative to traditional SUVs and minivans. Initially powered by a 3.5L V6 producing 265 HP, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available with front or all-wheel drive. A 3.7L V6 with 305 HP was added for the Sport model in 2011, while EcoBoost four-cylinder options were introduced in later years. The interior offered seating for five (with no third-row option) and emphasized passenger space and comfort with a substantial cargo area. A significant refresh in 2011 updated the styling, improved interior materials, and introduced MyFord Touch infotainment. The first-generation Edge successfully established the model as a core offering in Ford's lineup, appealing to customers seeking a practical, comfortable crossover without the size or fuel consumption of a traditional SUV."

    description: "The redesigned Edge moved to Ford's CD4 platform shared with the Fusion, featuring more sophisticated styling with a sleeker profile, while maintaining the distinctive Edge identity. Engine options evolved to focus on EcoBoost technology, including a standard 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, a 2.7L twin-turbo V6 for the Edge ST (replacing the Sport and producing 335 HP), and a naturally aspirated 3.5L V6 (discontinued after 2018). The interior saw significant improvements in material quality, design, and technology, featuring Ford's SYNC 3 infotainment system, available digital instrument cluster, and enhanced active safety features. A refresh in 2019 updated the styling with a wider grille and introduced the ST performance model replacing the Sport, while adding more advanced driver assistance features under the Ford Co-Pilot360 suite. For 2021, a larger 12-inch infotainment screen with SYNC 4 became standard. The second-generation Edge continues to target the two-row midsize crossover segment with a focus on technology, comfort, and available performance, particularly with the ST model which introduced a more serious performance credential to the mainstream crossover segment."
